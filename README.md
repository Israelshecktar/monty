# Monty Language Interpreter üöÄ

This project is a custom-built interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes. The Monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stops if either it executed every line of the file, it finds an error in the file, or an error occurred.

This project was carried out by Ewedairo Israel, a student at Alx Africa, under the supervision of Julien Barbier.

## Features üéà

- The Monty program is executed with the following command: monty file, where `file` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code.
- The program handles various opcodes, including `push`, `pall`, `pint`, `pop`, `swap`, `add`, `nop`, `sub`, `div`, `mul`, `mod`, `pchar`, `pstr`, `rotl`, `rotr`, `stack`, and `queue`.
- The program can operate in either stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO) mode, depending on the opcode.

## Usage üìö

After compiling the program with the provided command, you can run the Monty Language Interpreter using the following command:

`./monty <file_path>`

Replace `<file_path>` with the path to the file that contains the Monty bytecodes. For example, you could use:

`./monty test/00.m`

This will instruct the interpreter to read and execute the bytecodes from the '00.m' file in the 'bytecodes' directory
```c
shecktar@SHECKTAR-PC:~/monty$ cat test/07.m
push 1
push 2
push 3

## Getting Started üèÅ

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty`.
4. Run the program with a Monty byte codes file: `./monty test/00.m`.
